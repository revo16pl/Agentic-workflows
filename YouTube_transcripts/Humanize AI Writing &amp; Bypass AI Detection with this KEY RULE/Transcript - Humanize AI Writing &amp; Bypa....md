[00:00] So today I will teach you one single

[00:02] most important rule uh to apply when

[00:04] you're manually humanizing a written

[00:06] text to try to avoid a detection. This

[00:08] is just one thing that I always bear in

[00:10] mind when working on such manual edits

[00:13] and it just helps me decide what to

[00:15] change and how to change things. It

[00:17] really helps with the logic uh behind

[00:19] the process of manually humanizing a

[00:21] written text. To teach you that rule, I

[00:23] first have to teach you one quick rule

[00:25] about how AI writing works and then one

[00:27] quick rule for how AI detection works

[00:29] because it is the same rule and all

[00:31] these things overlap. And then I'll show

[00:33] you a real life example of how I apply

[00:35] this rule to text and how this changes

[00:37] the outcome of AI detector. So before we

[00:39] start, just a quick explanation. I do

[00:41] have all these videos in which I explain

[00:44] how to manually humanize a written text

[00:46] and they are still very much relevant

[00:49] and applicable and I do strongly

[00:50] encourage that you watch them. So in

[00:52] these videos I cover so many different

[00:54] rules and so many different practices

[00:56] such as changing the sentence length or

[00:59] looking out for triplet phrasing and

[01:01] trying to reduce dramat dramatization

[01:04] and and all these things. these typical

[01:07] uh characteristics of AI writing and all

[01:09] of this is still like I said very much

[01:11] applicable but underlying all of these

[01:14] processes and things there is this one

[01:16] single rule that I want to teach you

[01:18] today. So I'm whenever I'm working on

[01:20] these texts and I work on these texts a

[01:22] lot by the way if you want to learn how

[01:24] to do it there is uh so much that I have

[01:27] to offer. So there are individual

[01:28] one-to-one sessions that I offer. There

[01:30] is training and workshops that I offer

[01:32] online for how to do it as well as a

[01:34] service where I manually humanize your

[01:36] awitten text. So feel free to uh explore

[01:39] my website for all these services. But

[01:41] coming back to our topic of the video

[01:43] when I engage in these process and I

[01:45] reflected on what's my logic behind

[01:48] these processes I realized there is just

[01:50] one thing that I have overlooked in my

[01:52] previous videos and it is it is that

[01:54] rule. So quickly to understand it let me

[01:56] just explain very briefly how AI writing

[01:58] works. So the thing to know about AI

[02:00] writing is that the way it works is

[02:02] basically it's based on statistical

[02:04] probability. That's all it comes down

[02:06] to. There are many processes and

[02:08] algorithms, but it's really all about

[02:10] predictability. In other words, when AI

[02:13] writes, it doesn't really think about

[02:14] the outcome. It doesn't really plan or

[02:16] think how to say things. All it does, it

[02:19] just tries to compile a sentence and

[02:21] then a string of sentences and then

[02:23] paragraphs based on statistical

[02:25] probability. What it does is it inserts

[02:27] a word and then it inserts another word

[02:30] that's the most likely statistically

[02:32] likely word to follow that first word

[02:34] and then it inserts another word that's

[02:36] again statistically the most likely

[02:38] words to follow that word and that

[02:40] combination of words. It's all about

[02:42] stat statistical probability and that's

[02:44] all you need to know for now about how

[02:46] how a writing works. But then how does

[02:48] AI detection work? because then again

[02:51] this will lead us to how to humanize AI

[02:53] written text successfully and AI

[02:55] detection works exactly the same as AI

[02:57] writing works finally it's based on

[02:59] statistical probability so AI detection

[03:01] when uh the AI detector is looking at a

[03:04] certain uh sentence or string of

[03:06] sentence or paragraph or text again

[03:08] [snorts] it's using judgment so to speak

[03:12] based on statistical probability. So

[03:14] it's looking at a word or string of

[03:16] sentences and words and tries to predict

[03:19] what comes next. If it's successful in

[03:22] predict in predicting what comes next

[03:24] then it comes to conclusion that is

[03:26] probably AI writing because AI predicted

[03:28] that most statistically uh predictable

[03:31] outcome of the sentence or specifically

[03:33] the structure. So it managed to predict

[03:35] what comes next and then it managed to

[03:36] predict what comes next again. What this

[03:38] means is that this text was predictable

[03:41] for AI and it could uh safely conclude

[03:44] that it was also written by AI. And now

[03:47] we're getting to the topic of humanizing

[03:49] AI written text. And I wonder if you

[03:51] already suspect where this is going. So

[03:53] when we humanize a written text, what do

[03:55] we essentially have to do is to make

[03:57] sure that the text is less statistically

[03:59] predictable. Now you're thinking, okay,

[04:01] well easier said than done. I'm not a

[04:03] computer. I'm not an algorithm. how how

[04:05] do I know how statistically predictable

[04:07] this text is? But here's the rule and

[04:09] here is a simple really simple insight

[04:12] and trick. What you're looking at once

[04:14] you have your AI written text, what

[04:16] you're essentially looking at, remember

[04:18] is the text that's the most

[04:20] statistically predictable version of

[04:21] that text. What this means, in other

[04:23] words, is that any changes we do to it

[04:26] in practically

[04:29] predictable because it's different from

[04:31] that version that was statistically

[04:33] predictable and therefore created by AI.

[04:35] And now the skeptics will say, well,

[04:37] okay, but I've been in a situation where

[04:39] I changed a few words or more than a few

[04:41] words. It still was flagged as AI, so

[04:44] you're full of it. It's not exactly how

[04:46] it works. However, it's true and I've

[04:48] been there as well. However, how this

[04:51] works is not just about the words. The

[04:53] biggest problem, the biggest problem

[04:55] when we take AI written text and we try

[04:57] to humanize it is that we are still

[05:00] forced into or molded into that

[05:02] structure that this original AI writer

[05:06] gave us. So quite often we change many

[05:08] words, we change words within sentences.

[05:11] However, we are still in the same

[05:12] structure. There is still similar amount

[05:15] number of sentences in the paragraph.

[05:17] the sentences are kind of flowing in a

[05:19] similar way. Uh they have similar length

[05:22] and similar number of words even though

[05:24] we changed the words. We're still in

[05:26] that very same structure. So uh and that

[05:29] algorithm that I told you about is

[05:30] obviously much more complex than how I

[05:33] described it. So it still takes this

[05:35] structure and the combination of words

[05:38] and than the order of sentences and even

[05:40] their tenses and all this information

[05:43] and again calculates the statistical

[05:44] probability. So it's more than just

[05:46] replacing the words. So what it is about

[05:48] then is really messing things up a

[05:50] little bit. And this is where we come

[05:52] back to all these things that I told you

[05:54] about in the past. So changing the

[05:56] sentence length and structure and

[05:58] messing up the tenses sometimes or or

[06:01] changing introducing some passive

[06:02] instead of active sentences and so on

[06:04] and so forth. Just trying to make it

[06:07] different from what it is at the moment.

[06:09] And I'll show you in a second how I work

[06:11] on a on a sentence and how I redo it so

[06:14] that it does not get flagged. So what

[06:16] you can see on the screen is a GPT0

[06:20] uh workspace. I'm not the biggest fan of

[06:22] this AI detector and I usually

[06:24] discourage people from using it. Uh but

[06:26] the reason I discourage them from using

[06:28] it is because it's too aggressive. It's

[06:30] not a good AI detector. It's too

[06:31] aggressive. They pride themselves in

[06:33] high uh AI detection rate which is true

[06:36] but it's only because they also produce

[06:38] a high percentage of false positives. So

[06:40] basically misinterpreting human text as

[06:42] AI writing. They don't care if they are

[06:44] correct or not because they have their

[06:46] statistics. They can pride themselves

[06:47] and being in all almost every time

[06:50] detecting AI uh written text correctly.

[06:53] But I chose it for this video

[06:54] specifically for that purpose because

[06:55] it's so aggressive and so hardcore. So

[06:58] so here we have this text short text. I

[07:01] just want to give you an example of, you

[07:02] know, two sentences. Short text uh about

[07:05] the importance of teaching sports in

[07:06] schools. And if I scan it, you'll see

[07:09] that it does get flagged. It basically

[07:11] says it's uh 83% like pure AI and then

[07:15] it's it's been edited and and generally

[07:18] generally it's AI writing. So now I'll

[07:21] show you in a second I'll show you

[07:22] another version of this uh sentence uh

[07:26] except that I edited this sentence and

[07:28] then we'll look at the differences

[07:29] together. This is a new version of that

[07:31] sentence. Let's scan it. You can see

[07:34] that is human written. And now let me

[07:37] compare these two versions. So here what

[07:40] you can see is the original which means

[07:42] AI written text. And here is the edited

[07:45] version of it. So let's look at the

[07:46] original. It starts by talking about

[07:48] teaching sports in school and how it's

[07:49] important uh in development and then

[07:52] talks about things that are beyond the

[07:53] physical fitness. So like mental health,

[07:55] social development, engagement, academic

[07:57] engagement and whatnot. So then it turns

[08:00] to uh the physical aspect of

[08:02] development. So strength, coordination,

[08:04] endurance, and all the all these things.

[08:06] And this one was flagged by by AI. It

[08:10] doesn't really feel that much AIish.

[08:13] Although it kind of does because it has,

[08:14] for example, triplet phrasing, which I

[08:16] always talk about. So three things in a

[08:18] row. It does have a bit of like

[08:20] dramatization and and trying to justify

[08:23] the importance of something like

[08:24] starting by just saying something

[08:26] something fairly vague is like it's it

[08:28] plays a crucial role. Why not just say

[08:30] what it leads to? You always have to

[08:32] start like it always has to start with

[08:34] like plays a crucial role or has been a

[08:36] complex and popular topic. It always

[08:39] kind of introduces it first but it's not

[08:41] a big deal. However, clearly these

[08:44] things are statistically predictable.

[08:45] just the or even the order of things. Uh

[08:48] if you look at like a proper AI

[08:51] detector, it will tell you how often

[08:52] these things happen and you'll see that

[08:54] for example in like thousand or million

[08:55] text there is this exact same

[08:57] combination and same order like health,

[09:00] social development, academic engagement.

[09:01] So this means it's AI in my text the

[09:04] text I edited I did keep some of that

[09:07] stuff but I completely reversed the

[09:10] structure firstly. So I did start to

[09:12] talk about importance of teaching sports

[09:15] but then I just uh and I said it goes

[09:17] beyond physical fitness but then I did

[09:20] continue to talk about physical fitness.

[09:21] So I I said although it undoubtedly

[09:23] contributes to increased strength,

[09:24] endurance and all these things and then

[09:26] I said most importantly however is this

[09:29] non-physical

[09:31] uh non-physical you know stuff and

[09:33] non-physical outcomes. So mental health

[09:36] academic engagement so it's just already

[09:38] a different structure. Is it better? Is

[09:39] it worse? I mean to me it's better

[09:41] because also I thought about the whole

[09:43] message that I'm trying to send and I

[09:45] thought it makes more sense to at least

[09:47] mention the physical and then mention

[09:49] the non-physical aspects as opposed to

[09:52] here where it starts to talk about you

[09:54] know extending beyond physical aspects

[09:57] starts to talk about mental health and

[09:58] social engagement and then just randomly

[10:00] starts talking about the physical

[10:02] aspects. It's kind of weird like it's

[10:04] not the the main point. It's not the

[10:06] most important point that my sentence is

[10:08] some way in some way is better. It's

[10:10] just different. Remember this one was

[10:12] the most statistically predictable

[10:14] version. I already reversed the

[10:16] structure hoping that it will be less

[10:18] statistically predictable. But what is

[10:20] more important is that I reversed some

[10:22] uh some order as well. So for example, I

[10:24] still talk about areas like mental

[10:26] health, academic engagement, but as you

[10:29] can see, it's a different order already.

[10:31] Here it's talking about mental health,

[10:34] social development, academic engagement.

[10:36] And I talk about mental health, academic

[10:38] engagement, and development of social

[10:40] skills. I use a slightly different

[10:42] wording just hoping that I, you know,

[10:44] rather than social development, I can

[10:46] kind of make it more explanatory,

[10:47] descriptive, and and hope that it's also

[10:50] a structure that hasn't been used so

[10:51] many times. And the reason I reverse the

[10:54] order of mental health and academic

[10:55] engagement again is simply hoping that

[10:58] if mental health social development was

[11:01] the structure was the order picked by

[11:03] AI, I was hoping that if I reverse that

[11:06] order, it's already not the most common

[11:08] and the most predictable order. I did

[11:11] make some additions here as well. Also I

[11:13] I said most importantly however just to

[11:15] increase the flow and also because it

[11:16] wasn't there and also I introduced a

[11:18] little bit of like a passive tense to it

[11:20] because I said participation in sports

[11:22] has been known to influence other areas

[11:24] just because there was no no passive

[11:26] tense here I decided to introduce

[11:28] passive tense again to make it different

[11:30] uh hoping that it will be uh it won't be

[11:33] as statistically predictable as the

[11:35] first version of it. So these are just

[11:37] examples of what I did. But an important

[11:39] point to to be made here. None of what I

[11:42] did is the right way to do it. So don't

[11:44] feel like oh uh he introduced passive

[11:47] voice. He changed the order to things

[11:50] and then he changed the order of

[11:51] sentences and that's what I need to do.

[11:53] I'll make a note and that's what I'll do

[11:54] in my text. None of that. So don't don't

[11:57] you worry about trying to memorize these

[11:59] things or trying to replicate exactly

[12:01] what I did because it's not the point.

[12:03] It's not the point of what I'm trying to

[12:05] do here. Maybe I could have been fine

[12:08] with less changes. Maybe uh you would

[12:10] have introduced different changes than I

[12:12] did and you would probably be successful

[12:14] as well. So what is the point? Apart

[12:16] from this this phrase that I keep

[12:18] repeating making it less statistically

[12:20] predictable, but how do we decide and

[12:21] how do we do that? So the key point is

[12:23] when I'm looking at the text, what I'm

[12:25] trying to really achieve is I'm looking

[12:27] at the meaning. I'm trying to look at

[12:29] the meaning first. So I'm not focusing

[12:31] on individual sentence and trying to

[12:33] replace a few words and then moving on

[12:34] to the next one. I'm looking at the

[12:36] meaning ideally for two three sentences

[12:39] in a row. Sometimes the whole paragraph

[12:40] even and that's the best way to do it.

[12:43] So does it involve manual edits? Of

[12:45] course it does. So many people criticize

[12:47] me in the comments saying, "Oh wow, how

[12:50] did you come up with that? You basically

[12:51] are doing that manually." Well, of

[12:53] course I am. That's what we're trying to

[12:55] do here. We're trying to manually edit

[12:57] AI written text. There is no other way.

[12:59] So it does involve a lot of work. It

[13:01] does involve a lot of manual work.

[13:03] However, when you're looking

[13:05] holistically, let's say at the whole uh

[13:07] couple sentences or a paragraph, it

[13:09] actually makes it easier because if

[13:10] you're focusing uh on the level of

[13:12] individual sentences, there's a lot of

[13:14] mess. It will it's a lot of back and

[13:16] forth and you'll change a few words, it

[13:17] will clear the AI flag and then you'll

[13:20] change another sentence, it will go back

[13:22] to flagging it as a AI. So it actually

[13:25] is easier to look at the full context

[13:27] like a whole couple sentences or a whole

[13:30] paragraph and then try to just think

[13:33] what are they saying and how can I say

[13:35] it differently. How would I say it? And

[13:38] as I'm doing that I do look at the

[13:40] original sentence just to make sure that

[13:42] I didn't just repeat the whole sentence.

[13:44] And the most important thing and things

[13:46] I've been teaching you before changing

[13:48] the sentence lengths and changing the

[13:50] sentence structures. That's the key

[13:52] point. As I'm trying to do that, I

[13:54] always want to make sure that if there

[13:55] are long sentences, I may uh break down

[13:58] one of those long sentences into two

[14:00] short ones. If there are short

[14:02] sentences, I make create one longer

[14:04] sentences. One longer sentence or like

[14:07] here if there is no passive voice, I'll

[14:09] introduce passive voice. If there is no

[14:11] connector, transitional connector like

[14:14] however, most importantly, I will add it

[14:16] just to to introduce some key difference

[14:18] in structure. So I'm not fitting that

[14:20] into that same mold uh that structure

[14:23] that was dictated by by AI. And that's

[14:26] everything. Wow, this turned out to be a

[14:28] long video just about one simple rule.

[14:31] But I hope without all this talk.
