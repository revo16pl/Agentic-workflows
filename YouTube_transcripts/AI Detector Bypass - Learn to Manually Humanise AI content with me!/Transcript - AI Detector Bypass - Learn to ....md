[00:00] So by the end of this video, you'll have

[00:01] full understanding of how AI detectors

[00:04] work. So what exact elements of our

[00:07] writing these AI detectors pay attention

[00:09] to. So if you've been using Chajbd or

[00:12] some other AI tool to support your

[00:13] writing or to write some paragraphs for

[00:15] you now, you don't want to be flagged

[00:17] for uh AI generated content, you want to

[00:20] know exactly how to redo these

[00:22] paragraphs. And let's be honest, you

[00:24] don't want to be using these AI

[00:26] humanizer tools because they are

[00:28] completely useless. they will uh heavily

[00:30] affect the quality of your writing. So

[00:32] you have to know how to work on this

[00:34] yourself and how to restructure and then

[00:36] I'll show you an example of AI generated

[00:39] paragraph and I'll work on it and try to

[00:42] read it so that it doesn't get flagged

[00:43] for AI generated content. So first let's

[00:46] quickly go through uh the different

[00:48] factors or different elements of your

[00:49] writing that uh AI detectors uh pay

[00:52] attention to. So it's not just about the

[00:54] words as some people think. It's not

[00:56] just about these favorite words that AI

[00:59] uses. It's about so much more than that.

[01:02] So the first metric and these two are

[01:04] the most commonly cited statistical

[01:06] metrics or text perplexity and

[01:09] burstiness. So basically perplexity is a

[01:11] measure of how surprised a language

[01:13] model is by our text because human

[01:15] writing tends to have a higher

[01:17] perplexity because it's more

[01:19] unpredictable. AI content on the other

[01:21] hand is more statistically uh expected

[01:24] and therefore has less perplexity and

[01:26] burstiness is pretty related is is uh

[01:30] about variation. So so human writing

[01:32] again it it has variation in sentence

[01:35] length structure word choice while uh AI

[01:39] tends to be just uniform. Then sentence

[01:41] structure and grammar. So consistency

[01:44] and polish these are things that are

[01:47] taken into account uh because AI

[01:49] generated text is usually grammatically

[01:51] flawless uh and stylistically

[01:54] consistent. Quite often it's just too

[01:56] consistent. Then AI does have its

[01:58] favorite words like I said it may repeat

[02:00] words, phrases or sentences and it just

[02:03] does it uh too often. And another one is

[02:05] very subtle. It's about transitions.

[02:07] It's good to use these expressions, but

[02:09] AI likes to overuse these expressions,

[02:11] these connectors like therefore,

[02:12] however, in conclusion. Again, this

[02:15] overlaps with the the favorite

[02:16] expressions that it just like to to

[02:18] overuse. Vocabulary and word choice very

[02:21] related again overlaps. It's about

[02:23] favorite expressions. At the same time,

[02:24] it's using safe vocabulary. So, very

[02:28] rarely does it use any colloquial words.

[02:30] Um, for our academic writing is not a

[02:33] big problem. So here I just chose

[02:35] whatever is relevant for academic

[02:37] writing of course and then when we talk

[02:39] about fixing things again I'm talking

[02:40] about fixing for academic writing

[02:42] because you can see some guidelines

[02:44] online for how to fix how to humanize

[02:46] content and we will talk about things

[02:48] like adding humor personal anecdotes

[02:50] making it inconsistent and open-ended

[02:52] but it's usually talking about our

[02:54] everyday language. So maybe if you're

[02:56] writing a blog here, we're talking about

[02:58] academic text of course. So it so the

[03:01] bar is much higher. But about the

[03:03] vocabulary and AI, it's learned to

[03:05] predict what comes next. So again, it

[03:07] takes this most predictable path

[03:09] essentially when writing our content for

[03:12] us and then later gets our content gets

[03:14] flagged by AI for the exact same reason.

[03:16] Terms of coherence and depth of AI

[03:19] writing. Again, it's not always easy to

[03:21] spot, but it does focus on the surface

[03:24] uh level meaning quite often lacks

[03:27] originality argumentation. And then it

[03:29] uses the statements that do seem fine

[03:31] for academic writing, but again it

[03:33] really depends on the context of where

[03:34] they appear. So they appear meaningful,

[03:36] but they are not always meaningful. So

[03:37] like it's important to consider all

[03:39] perspectives. It can be a meaningful

[03:41] statement or it can be just there for

[03:43] the sake of it. And this often the

[03:45] latter often happens in AI writing. And

[03:47] then finally it may compare our writing

[03:50] to know other known outputs. So their

[03:52] language corpora and uh both for AI

[03:55] language and human language and some of

[03:56] these detectors they make use of this uh

[04:00] huge database of language of any

[04:02] possible use of language that there

[04:04] exists. So so again that's another

[04:06] factor. So you can see that there are

[04:08] more factors than just the words that AI

[04:10] uses. This is what people tend to think.

[04:12] So they think that they will just

[04:13] replace these favorite expressions of uh

[04:16] AI or CHBD and the text will become

[04:19] undetectable and then they're surprised

[04:20] that it's still uh very much detectable.

[04:23] So it's there is so much more. It's

[04:25] mainly if I had to pick one, it is

[04:26] really about the structure. You have to

[04:28] introduce variation in the structure.

[04:30] We'll go through it. So now I'll go

[04:32] through some ideas for how to humanize

[04:34] that text. and I I'll continue to talk

[04:36] about some issues with AI uh created or

[04:40] generated content and then I'll show you

[04:42] an example of AI generated content how

[04:44] it's flagged 100% AI generated and then

[04:46] how I'll work on some uh some changes

[04:49] and to make it less or to make it

[04:52] undetectable. So the first way to fix AI

[04:54] generated content and humanize it is to

[04:56] introduce intellectual hesitation which

[04:58] is a normal thing that is expected in

[05:00] academic writing anyway. So basically AI

[05:03] likes to write in absolutes in uh

[05:05] present information as factual

[05:07] statements as something that's just sure

[05:09] and scholars on the other hand or humans

[05:11] for that matter they hedge they suggest

[05:13] they suspect. So so it's about using

[05:16] this kind of language which again in any

[05:18] case is something that you have to do in

[05:20] academic writing. So you don't like you

[05:22] don't want to be presenting things as

[05:24] facts. Instead you're talking about uh

[05:26] there uh being a possibility that

[05:28] something happens. it appears that

[05:30] something is true. Uh it is suspected,

[05:33] it is believed, it is likely. So this

[05:35] kind of thing, this is something that AI

[05:37] rarely rarely does. So it will say

[05:39] social media has an impact on uh

[05:42] whatever self-esteem and it's not

[05:44] something that we like to do like I said

[05:46] in any case, but especially if we want

[05:48] to avoid being flagged for AI content.

[05:50] Another one is to add subtle critique.

[05:52] Critique critique critique

[05:55] critique critique. Jesus. A subtle crit

[06:00] critique critique critique

[06:04] uh critique pronunciation

[06:08] critique

[06:11] pronunciation critique. Another one is

[06:13] to add subtle critique. And I'm laughing

[06:15] because I just spent a little bit of

[06:17] time trying to trying to learn how to

[06:19] pronounce the word the word critique.

[06:21] This is again pretty obvious because in

[06:22] academic writing you do have to present

[06:24] different uh points of view. Anyway, so

[06:27] AI will present things uh it will just

[06:30] factually present a statement that

[06:32] somebody does or says something whereas

[06:35] as a human we want to point out maybe

[06:37] some inconsistencies or point to some

[06:39] other points of view. It's not something

[06:41] you can do to every sentence. So we'll

[06:42] go through every sentence in a second

[06:43] but it's something that generally should

[06:45] be present. And now this one is very

[06:47] important. This one will be uh important

[06:49] at the level of sentences and and just

[06:51] has to be uh present everywhere as we

[06:54] make our way through this AI generated

[06:57] context. So to introduce uh variation in

[07:00] sentence opening uh openings and syntax.

[07:03] So AI will often start sentences in the

[07:06] exact same way even if we don't

[07:08] initially notice it. So things like this

[07:10] study this shows it is important. So

[07:13] there are these little repetitions and

[07:15] again they are very uh to our basically

[07:17] human eye it's it's very difficult to

[07:19] spot but they are almost exact uh in

[07:22] their structure and their length which

[07:24] then adds to the rest of the structure

[07:25] of the sentence and overall the whole

[07:27] sentence tends to have the same kind of

[07:29] number of beats same number of sometimes

[07:31] even similar number of syllables words

[07:33] length and so on and so forth. So by

[07:35] adding this this variation and how we

[07:38] introduce our sentences we are breaking

[07:40] down that structure already. So we can

[07:42] use introductory clauses, dependent

[07:44] clauses, inverted structures rather than

[07:46] just uh repeating that same exact

[07:49] structure of a sentence. So things like

[07:50] although widely cited, this study has

[07:53] received little empirical follow-up.

[07:54] It's already a little bit different or

[07:56] central to this argument is the notion

[07:57] of so just uh reversing the order.

[08:00] You'll see when I go through individual

[08:01] uh sentences what I mean just reversing

[08:03] the order and introducing this

[08:05] variation. So now you know what factors

[08:06] are being considered by AI detectors.

[08:09] how you know roughly in theory how to

[08:12] humanize the content. And now let's have

[08:14] a look at how we can actually humanize

[08:16] the content. So let's have a look at

[08:18] exact example sentence generated by AI

[08:21] and see how we can change it and

[08:23] humanize it so it's undetectable. But

[08:25] before I continue, have a look at my

[08:26] website and the range of services that I

[08:28] offer that are relevant to any aspect

[08:30] and any stage of your study. They

[08:32] include Zoom tutorials, data analysis

[08:34] services or writing support. Okay. So,

[08:36] what we can see here now is a paragraph

[08:38] that I asked Chad GBT to produce. If the

[08:42] sound quality is slightly different,

[08:43] it's just because I switched computers.

[08:45] Hopefully, it's not too bad. But this is

[08:46] the paragraph that we're going to to

[08:48] work on. Now, just to show you that it

[08:51] it is being flagged for AI generated

[08:53] content. Let me paste it here to this

[08:55] free tool, detect AI. Uh, sure enough,

[08:59] 100% generated by AI. So, we'll have to

[09:02] work on it a little bit. So I pasted it

[09:04] to Microsoft Word and let uh let us

[09:07] begin the work. So the first sentence,

[09:08] self-esteem plays a critical role in

[09:10] shaping a communicative experience of

[09:12] migrants using English second language.

[09:14] Firstly, if I liked it, I could just

[09:15] keep it. Uh as I said, what is really

[09:17] more important are not individual

[09:19] sentences, just how they are glued

[09:21] together. So uh occasionally, if I

[09:22] really like something, I can change it.

[09:25] uh as long as I make sure that the

[09:26] following sentence does not follow the

[09:29] exact same pattern like I said the

[09:31] number of beats and and uh generally the

[09:34] length. So uh here I will uh tone it

[09:37] down a little bit. So I'll say as I said

[09:39] uh I don't like and nobody does in

[09:41] academia to present things as factual

[09:44] statements. So rather than it plays a

[09:45] critical role, I'll say it uh can play a

[09:49] critical role. And at the end, we'll

[09:51] just add the reference because again,

[09:52] it's something that normally would be

[09:55] expected to be referenced anyway. So,

[09:57] let me just say it's some somebody

[09:59] called Jackson 2020. And this already

[10:03] kind of breaks down the sentence a

[10:04] little bit. And the second sentence is

[10:06] high self-esteem fosters confidence,

[10:08] which is essential for engaging in

[10:10] conversations, expressing needs, and

[10:12] participating social, educational, and

[10:14] professional context.

[10:17] I don't like some of it. For example,

[10:20] participating in social educational

[10:22] professional context seems a little bit

[10:25] vague. So, so this is another in my

[10:27] opinion a little bit of a giveaway. Not

[10:29] so much, but it's just something I don't

[10:31] like. In any case, uh it's talking about

[10:35] uh confidence, which is essential for

[10:37] engaging conversations. So, we're

[10:39] talking about conversations, which is

[10:40] fine. So, why then talk about social and

[10:42] participating in social education

[10:44] professional context? So I feel like we

[10:46] just have to simplify it. So that's

[10:48] generally my approach. I have to

[10:49] understand the sentence first and then

[10:51] think of how I can possibly uh talk

[10:54] about it in a way that I just like more

[10:56] than what it says now. And usually this

[10:59] includes deleting some things that are

[11:01] just not needed. Remember what I told

[11:02] you about surface level meaning and

[11:04] things it says that kind of make sense

[11:06] but then they don't really. So I'll

[11:08] start by again toning it down. I'll say

[11:10] it um has also been shown that high

[11:16] self-esteem can increase so so again

[11:19] toning down can increase

[11:23] uh

[11:24] confidence which is a chance for

[11:26] engaging blah blah blah and then

[11:28] participating there is just too much

[11:30] information can increase

[11:32] confidence and as a result um their

[11:36] willingness or migrants doesn't matter

[11:38] their willing ness to to

[11:42] participate in

[11:44] various

[11:47] conversational contexts exchanges. It

[11:50] doesn't matter. It's not perfect either,

[11:52] but basically the the

[11:54] the message is the same. Hopefully, you

[11:57] agree there's too much about the

[11:59] conversation and expressing needs. It's

[12:01] just about confidence and being willing

[12:02] to participate, to engage in

[12:04] conversation. So, now let's continue.

[12:06] Again, it's not a bad word and I use it

[12:08] conversely. I just feel like here I'll

[12:11] include some variation again to to

[12:14] influence the overall length even of the

[12:16] sentence. I'll say low self-esteem I'll

[12:19] also uh reverse the order as I said

[12:22] earlier. So low low self-esteem on the

[12:24] other hand and there is a lot to unpack

[12:26] here again. So it may hinder

[12:28] communication but by increasing anxiety,

[12:30] fear of judgment and reluctance to speak

[12:34] which doesn't make that much sense

[12:36] because again it's uh or maybe it makes

[12:38] some sense anyway. Ultimately affecting

[12:40] language development and social

[12:42] integration which is again a little bit

[12:44] about communication. It's just about

[12:45] simplifying. I want to simplify this. Uh

[12:48] so low self-esteem on the other hand may

[12:52] affect social integration mainly due to

[12:56] increased anxiety and fear of judgment.

[13:00] It doesn't have to be this way. Maybe I

[13:02] could keep u some elements but I feel

[13:05] like again it communicates the point

[13:08] that I was trying to make. Migrants who

[13:10] perceive their English skills as

[13:12] inadequate may may internalize feelings

[13:14] of inferiority reinforcing inclusion and

[13:17] margin

[13:18] marginalization whatever. Um let's see

[13:22] what we can do here. The sentence is

[13:24] good. I like it. I would normally like

[13:26] it. But then remember and this is

[13:28] probably the what will cause us problem.

[13:32] There is another sentence that's again

[13:34] very similar in length in structure even

[13:36] though it's a different sentence. So

[13:37] then it says therefore supporting

[13:39] self-esteem is vital not only for

[13:40] linguistic competence but also for

[13:42] promoting migrants overall well-being

[13:45] and inclusion almost every time it lists

[13:48] things is almost every time is two

[13:50] things uh divided by and so it's just

[13:53] too

[13:54] similar. Uh the previous sentence was

[13:56] also about something and something and

[13:58] then there is this almost exact same

[14:00] structure. So I want to to avoid that. I

[14:03] want to again get the overall sense of

[14:06] what it means and combine it maybe into

[14:09] now something that's a little bit longer

[14:11] maybe slightly uh clumsy even so um as

[14:16] and also rever reverse the order so as

[14:20] low self-perceived or selfassessed we

[14:24] could say English skills skills are

[14:28] believed remember about toning down

[14:32] uh to lead to inferior iority complex to

[14:34] lead to

[14:36] inferiority complex and exclusion

[14:39] marginalization is I mean arguably

[14:42] slightly different but for now it will

[14:45] do an exclusion so as it's believed to

[14:48] lead to these these things is vital it

[14:50] says we have to do it so it is crucial

[14:54] to support

[14:56] self esteem building to promote the

[15:00] migrants linguistic

[15:03] and social inclusion. Uh because that's

[15:07] what it says, promoting their well-being

[15:09] and inclusion and the language

[15:12] linguistic competence. So, this should

[15:15] do. Hopefully, it's not too uh short

[15:19] because I think it has to be 80 words.

[15:21] It Yeah, that's enough uh for this uh

[15:25] for this tool that we were using. So now

[15:27] let's go to the

[15:31] tool. Delete

[15:37] this

[15:39] 0%. It did take a little bit of of work

[15:43] and I cut out some sequences when I was

[15:46] thinking. Uh but that's basically what

[15:48] happens. That's what happens. So I think

[15:51] my main message to you would

[15:54] be read it. Try to understand what it

[15:57] says and try to say it in your own

[16:00] words. In fact, what I would normally

[16:02] do, I would probably have it as separate

[16:04] paragraphs. I try to literally forget

[16:06] what it said exactly. I just want to

[16:08] remember the meaning and then say it in

[16:10] my own words, but it's very hard because

[16:11] you're influenced by what you just saw.

[16:14] And it does have good sentences, but

[16:16] basically that's what happens. I hope
