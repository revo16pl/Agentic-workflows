[00:00] I've been avoiding Claude Code for

[00:02] months. It seemed too technical and too

[00:04] complicated. However, my friend Mark has

[00:06] been begging me to start using it. He is

[00:07] hands down the best person to learn

[00:09] Claude code from. So, I brought him on

[00:11] this episode to teach me how to use it

[00:13] from scratch. And I'm going to be

[00:14] honest, after this episode, I went down

[00:16] the Claude Code rabbit hole and spent

[00:17] the entire weekend building a system

[00:19] that literally used to take me 20 hours

[00:21] every single week. And I'm using it

[00:23] right now. Here's what nobody told me

[00:24] about Claude Code. It reads your files.

[00:26] It remembers your preferences. And it

[00:28] learns how you work. So, the more you

[00:30] use it, the smarter it gets. And it

[00:31] doesn't just give you answers, it

[00:33] actually builds things for you and saves

[00:35] them to your computer. So, by the end of

[00:36] this episode, you're going to know

[00:37] exactly how to set this up, start using

[00:39] it yourself, even if you've never

[00:41] written a single line of code, and begin

[00:43] automating all aspects of your work.

[00:45] Believe me, if you've been meaning to

[00:46] try Claude Code, and start using it

[00:48] yourself, but it seemed too technical,

[00:49] this is absolutely the best video you

[00:51] should watch on how to get started. So,

[00:53] with that being said, let's get into it.

[00:55] All right, what is going on, guys? I'm

[00:56] stoked for this episode. Personally,

[00:58] I've been wanting to use Claude Code for

[01:01] quite some time now. I want to bring on

[01:02] the goat of Claude Code in my eyes,

[01:04] Mark. So, yeah, I'm hoping today we

[01:06] could a get me up to speed using Claude

[01:08] Code, get my audience up to speed, and

[01:10] build something cool in this podcast.

[01:11] So, yeah, happy to have you, Mark.

[01:13] >> Yeah, of course. Uh, it's pleasure to be

[01:14] here. I know it's been a while since we

[01:15] last touched base. We were probably

[01:18] >> more in the Vibe Code world before, and

[01:20] now we're getting into the real Cody

[01:22] world now. So, that's good.

[01:24] >> Yeah, 100%. So, I'm stoked to see what

[01:26] we could build with Claude Code. I've

[01:28] never actually been able to build

[01:29] anything with it. So, to kickstart this,

[01:30] I want to ask one question, and that is

[01:33] Claude Co-work just dropped literally

[01:35] yesterday before we were going to film

[01:37] this podcast. So, for my audience, what

[01:39] do you think? Is Claude Co-work

[01:40] something that replaces the need to

[01:42] learn Claude code? Do you think it's

[01:43] like an entry like gateway drug thing?

[01:46] Like, give me your rundown on that?

[01:47] Because I like to use you as a filter

[01:49] for AI tools to see like, should I pay

[01:51] attention to this? Is it overrated?

[01:52] What? So, give me your rundown.

[01:53] >> Yeah, for sure. You stole my

[01:55] description, first of all, so let's make

[01:56] that a disclaimer. It it is the gateway

[01:59] drug. Up until now, the average person

[02:01] looks at a terminal and no matter how

[02:02] many times someone like me shouts and

[02:04] screams and cries, we can't convince

[02:07] people to hop in a terminal cuz there's

[02:08] like this mental block that terminal

[02:11] equals code. Code equals I don't know

[02:13] how to do it, so I walk away. So this

[02:15] gives you this kind of like top offunnel

[02:17] taste of what cloud code can do. So

[02:19] cloud code or co-work rather is is a

[02:22] decent like adjustment to dealing with

[02:25] more hands-on agentic workflows without

[02:28] dealing with all the setup, the

[02:30] download, the uh blinking cursor on your

[02:33] screen if you're using a terminal. It's

[02:35] still full of bugs, but it's still like

[02:36] one big step up from using the normal

[02:38] cloudi.

[02:39] >> Gotcha. So we're not using inside of an

[02:41] IDE, for example. Where are we using

[02:43] this? We're using this inside of the

[02:44] cloud desktop app, right? So that's

[02:46] something that's like more accessible

[02:47] for most people cuz a lot of people

[02:49] might have clawed desktop downloaded.

[02:51] You could just toggle between chat and

[02:53] co-work mode instead of having to go

[02:54] into your IDE. So I think it'd be

[02:56] helpful to show kind of a little rundown

[02:57] of what the UI looks like real quick and

[03:00] then that'll segue us into our next

[03:02] section of actually using cloud code to

[03:03] build something

[03:04] >> for sure. So this is what it looks like.

[03:07] So on cloud desktop you have chat, you

[03:10] have code and now you have co-work. So

[03:12] the whole point of co-work like we said

[03:14] before is they basically took the most

[03:17] common non-technical things coming

[03:20] through cloud code and made them

[03:21] available as one-click buttons and when

[03:23] you click on these buttons instead of

[03:25] you having to think about the prompt it

[03:27] does the prompt engineering for you. So,

[03:29] if you say organize files, which is the

[03:31] main use case everyone's going off on on

[03:34] X, you can just say go and fix this

[03:36] folder, you would tell it which folder

[03:38] you want to work in. And then you want

[03:40] to specify if you want how you want it

[03:42] to organize it or specifically what the

[03:43] name of the folder is. They give you

[03:45] some defaults like my downloads folder,

[03:47] my photos, some old projects, etc. And

[03:50] then when you go through the process,

[03:51] you can pick one of the language models

[03:53] of choice and everything that's

[03:55] happening will appear on the right hand

[03:56] side. In the world of cloud code,

[03:58] everything is very monotone and happens

[04:00] one thing at a time. So if you do need

[04:03] that aesthetic artifact look, then this

[04:05] will help you keep track of exactly

[04:07] what's happening.

[04:08] >> Okay. So you're saying we could make

[04:10] edits to our folders, organize folders,

[04:12] all this stuff, create presentations

[04:13] from folders, and then even spin up like

[04:15] a UI, kind of like a vibecoded user

[04:18] interface directly inside of the cloud

[04:20] desktop app now using co-work. Right.

[04:22] >> Exactly. So before you could already

[04:23] create the vibe coded apps with

[04:25] artifacts on their own, but now they

[04:26] just made it that much easier to be able

[04:28] to keep track of all the files, all the

[04:30] contexts being used and you can still

[04:33] use connectors and add connectors. So

[04:35] you don't lose that MCP flare. You can

[04:38] layer it on and not everyone's going to

[04:40] need to reorganize the same folder 10

[04:42] times. So you need to find better use

[04:43] cases, right? These are just some

[04:45] examples that people can wrap their head

[04:47] around. But when you go through the

[04:48] experience, for example, I tested the

[04:51] crunch data. It will go to the folder,

[04:54] come up with a plan, and you'll notice

[04:56] that when you click on them, you'll get

[04:57] this prompt here that says, "Ask any

[04:59] clarifying questions." So, they're

[05:00] trying to encourage you to encourage it

[05:03] to think and plan before doing things to

[05:05] lower the likelihood that you break

[05:07] something. Cuz in cloud code, if you

[05:09] don't know what you're doing, sometimes

[05:10] you can completely nuke your desktop if

[05:12] you're not actually prompting correctly.

[05:14] >> Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so now

[05:15] let's segue into actually using Claude

[05:18] Code because obviously Cloud Codework is

[05:19] good for super nontechnical people. I've

[05:21] been playing around with it. It's been

[05:22] great so far. It's been a good entry

[05:24] into Claude Code, but I want to know

[05:25] like does this get you like 90% of the

[05:28] way? Do you think it gets you 50% of the

[05:29] way? Where do you think it kind of

[05:30] leaves non-technical people when it

[05:33] comes to cla?

[05:36] >> If we extend the analogy of the gateway

[05:38] drug, key emphasis on drug, this to me

[05:41] gives you 30 to 40%. This is not even

[05:43] close to the firepower of Claude and

[05:46] it's full of bugs. Why? Because they

[05:48] used Claude code to vibe code it in the

[05:50] span of a week. So the actual anthropic

[05:52] team admitted that on X. So with any

[05:55] vibe coded app, as you'll be familiar,

[05:57] and I'm familiar, you're going to have

[05:59] tons of bugs, especially when you go to

[06:01] production, go to thousands and millions

[06:03] of people. Tinker with it, play with it,

[06:05] know that there's bugs, but this is only

[06:08] meant to be the taste of what you get

[06:09] with full firepower.

[06:10] >> Got it. Makes sense. Cool. Cool. So, I

[06:12] want to move on to a couple questions

[06:13] before we actually go ahead, show you

[06:15] how to download Cloud Code, and then

[06:16] actually build something with it. Um,

[06:18] Mark actually built something for me, a

[06:20] cool use case I've been wanting myself.

[06:22] And we're going to go through kind of

[06:23] the step-by-step process, how we did

[06:24] that, and then also the the finished

[06:26] product of that. So, my first question

[06:28] for you is like what's the biggest

[06:29] misconception with cloud code? Cuz when

[06:31] I hear that, I think, okay, if I'm not

[06:33] coding an app or using it in my coding

[06:35] environment, what's the point of using

[06:36] cloud code? So, kind of break down what

[06:38] the biggest misconception or, you know,

[06:39] few misconceptions you see are. Yeah. So

[06:42] obviously it was a platform originally

[06:44] designed for developers which is why

[06:46] they called it Claude code. But over

[06:48] time a lot of non-technical people and a

[06:50] lot of non-technical use cases popped up

[06:52] which in my opinion I talked to a lot of

[06:53] people I say they should have called it

[06:55] claude creates because then it could

[06:57] create code and artifacts. But the

[06:59] misconception is that you only use it

[07:01] for development or building code or vibe

[07:04] coding. In reality, because it has

[07:06] access to your desktop and your files

[07:08] and you can create a local uh database

[07:11] that runs on your computer, which we

[07:12] will show you today, it can do whatever

[07:14] you want. Like the limit is your

[07:16] imagination and your ability to just

[07:17] like learn by osmosis. So when you ask

[07:20] it here, go to the nano banana API, make

[07:22] an a thumbnail of me for YouTube, it can

[07:25] go research, look for the nanobanana

[07:27] API, tell you, hey, listen, I need an

[07:29] API key. here's the URL to go get the

[07:31] API key. Give it to me and we'll go from

[07:33] here. You're going to see Python on

[07:35] screen. You don't have to engage in that

[07:37] Python. You just have to be aware that

[07:39] something's happening to make that

[07:40] functionality work. So, the less you are

[07:43] worried about what's happening on screen

[07:44] and you kind of take a peek at it. Even

[07:46] if you're not technical, you will start

[07:48] to see little patterns by osmosis and

[07:50] you'll be surprised in 3 6 9 months

[07:52] you'll be able to upskill yourself by

[07:54] accident.

[07:55] >> Okay. Yeah, I love that. And then I

[07:56] guess my next question would be do you

[07:58] have any like non- techy success stories

[08:00] of like somebody because you run a

[08:01] pretty big I wouldn't call it a claude

[08:03] code community but your community is

[08:05] built like a lot of your users in there

[08:08] or your community members are wanting to

[08:10] know everything about cloud code and all

[08:11] the use cases you find for it. So do you

[08:13] have any like non-technical like

[08:15] whatever just somebody who might be a

[08:17] bit archaic when it comes to technology

[08:19] going from complete beginner to actually

[08:20] being able to build useful things with

[08:22] it?

[08:22] >> Yeah. Yeah. So obviously I have a

[08:24] mid-tier kind of size community, but we

[08:26] get a lot of non-technical people coming

[08:28] in that have decided that's it. I am

[08:30] going to dig my heels in. I'm paying for

[08:32] the max plan and I'm going to build

[08:34] stuff. And we recently had someone

[08:35] that's actually 70 years old, retired,

[08:38] basically built a full mobile app in the

[08:41] span of 3 or 4 months using Annaiden and

[08:43] Claude Code. And stuff like that gets me

[08:46] as a like a super nerd super excited

[08:48] because I love seeing that progress and

[08:50] people shattering limiting beliefs

[08:52] because people will always come in who

[08:54] are not technical and say, "Hey, listen.

[08:55] Do you got something for me that's not

[08:57] clawed code? Can I just use like chat

[08:59] better cuz they're just so afraid of

[09:01] just like leaping in and running into

[09:03] those first issues." But as soon as you

[09:04] get past that hump where one, you've

[09:06] downloaded it, two, you go by trial by

[09:08] fire. You try to build something and

[09:10] something doesn't work. And then you

[09:11] realize that you could technically ask

[09:13] cloud code in a virgin window to help

[09:15] you fix cloud code and you understand

[09:17] this little feedback loop. Then they're

[09:19] unchained. And then once the imagination

[09:21] is open, they start building from very

[09:23] minute use cases to things that they're

[09:25] proud of and then just stacking those

[09:26] skills on top of that.

[09:27] >> Yeah, I love that. And that you just

[09:29] literally explained me. I haven't used

[09:30] cloud code because it just whatever I

[09:32] have the like this mental barrier about

[09:34] it. And I had that in the beginning with

[09:35] AI in general and that's why I created

[09:37] this YouTube channel to like show

[09:38] nontechnical people you can use AI tools

[09:40] and actually become like a speaker of

[09:42] that language so to say. So yeah, I I

[09:44] love that. Going on a little bit like I

[09:46] guess my last question here before

[09:47] diving into showing how to download

[09:49] cloud code and then actually building

[09:51] out our use case for this. What do you

[09:52] think a downside or the downsides of not

[09:55] using cloud code are now? cuz it seems

[09:58] like this is where the AI space is

[09:59] going. And just like if you want to be

[10:01] able to like 10x your productivity, 100x

[10:03] whatever like do you think we're if

[10:04] we're not using cloud code, we're

[10:06] missing out on opportunity here and it

[10:07] might not be just claimed

[10:10] could be kind of like a transferable

[10:12] language we could use for these other

[10:13] tools. So what do you think the

[10:15] downsides of not learning this is?

[10:17] >> Yeah, it's good that you gave that

[10:18] disclaimer cuz I was going to give that

[10:19] disclaimer to your audience. One, this

[10:21] is not a Cloud Code shilling video. I

[10:23] like to use Cloud Code cuz I've tested

[10:24] multiple products. It's the one that I

[10:26] resonate with the most with my

[10:27] development style. But you do have

[10:28] cursor, you have windsurf, you have open

[10:31] code now, which is becoming competitive.

[10:32] I think they have like a [clears throat]

[10:33] million active users that are using open

[10:35] source models. You can use whatever you

[10:37] want. It's the idea that you use

[10:39] language models in a terminal where you

[10:42] are devoid of all these little pretty

[10:44] icons on a UI and you go straight to the

[10:47] source. That's the theme of this

[10:49] episode. So I think that if you don't

[10:51] opt into the terminal world, not

[10:53] necessarily the cloud code world, you

[10:55] are missing out because you are going to

[10:56] the source. So when you go to the

[10:58] source, you realize it's kind of like

[11:00] waking up from a dream. You look around

[11:02] at like 90% of AI tools. You're like,

[11:04] "Oh, I don't need these. I can cancel

[11:06] hundreds of subscriptions." And I

[11:08] canceled a few months ago $1,200 a month

[11:10] worth of subscriptions because I

[11:12] literally realized I didn't need it

[11:13] anymore. If I wanted to compress videos,

[11:16] I don't need to pay for the service that

[11:17] does it. I can just tell it and it

[11:19] creates a Python script that does it for

[11:21] me. You can start to tackle each

[11:23] subscription of your time which is why I

[11:25] can justify my very expensive

[11:27] subscription to cloud code. So it's a

[11:29] matter of using it from day one for ROI

[11:32] heavy activities.

[11:32] >> Got it. Last question. I lied. My last

[11:34] one's not my last one. So what's like a

[11:36] use case that you've built yourself that

[11:38] you use for cloud code that like you're

[11:40] hands off. It's saved you a bunch of

[11:41] time. I know you and I have talked off

[11:43] camera about it. So what's like one

[11:44] thing you've built where you're just

[11:45] like this used to take me hours or used

[11:47] to take a team member hours and now it's

[11:49] just kind of done with cloud code.

[11:50] >> Yeah, there's one thing that not wasn't

[11:52] possible but would be super painful for

[11:54] me to do with the little time that I

[11:55] have. And there's one thing that was a

[11:57] major unlock. So the major unlock was I

[11:59] have a YouTube command center which is

[12:01] unbelievable. Now it's taken me probably

[12:03] I've put in 100 hours into this command

[12:05] center where I go back and forth and it

[12:08] goes and looks at like things that are

[12:09] trending, things that are new. We have a

[12:11] bit of a conversation and then once we

[12:13] land on a topic I kind of give it my

[12:15] ideas where I want to take it and where

[12:16] I want to go and then from that idea it

[12:18] goes and creates 15 thumbnails very high

[12:21] quality. It takes images of me

[12:23] transforms them to go with that

[12:24] thumbnail. Creates a thumbnail brief. It

[12:26] creates an editing and a script brief

[12:28] for my editing team and creates SEO

[12:30] tags, titles, descriptions, everything

[12:32] from one input. Which is why for me once

[12:34] I started on this drug I got addicted

[12:37] because once you can have one input and

[12:39] you have not infinite but many outputs

[12:42] as a result of that one that is the very

[12:43] definition of leverage. So once I did

[12:45] that every part of my life I started

[12:47] creating what I call command center. So

[12:49] this is my copywriting command center. I

[12:51] started on LinkedIn. So I wanted to

[12:52] understand how do I write copy on

[12:54] LinkedIn without using AI but like

[12:56] understanding the principles. How do I

[12:57] do a crash course on everything? Let's

[12:59] create a command center. So creating

[13:02] those command centers helped level me up

[13:04] because even as a developer, I get to

[13:06] learn things I would have never been

[13:07] exposed to otherwise.

[13:08] >> Yeah, 100%. Being somebody that makes

[13:10] YouTube videos, literally I spend 15

[13:12] plus hours a week probably on this and

[13:14] that bottlenecks every single other

[13:16] thing when it comes to like my business.

[13:17] Like my creative mind is not working cuz

[13:19] I have to go and I have to come up with

[13:20] these thumbnail ideas, title ideas. I

[13:22] think one thing, and I could be wrong

[13:24] here, but what sets it apart is you're

[13:26] not just like saying go off and do this

[13:28] thing and it does all of it. You have to

[13:29] play around with it because if you

[13:31] didn't come to that like idea or you

[13:33] know whatever the title was going to be

[13:35] like you had to kind of play around with

[13:36] it to get that title. You know what I'm

[13:38] saying? Instead of just saying hey go

[13:39] create a title for me on whatever

[13:41] whatever you think is going to work

[13:42] well. So you have to have a little bit

[13:43] of that back and forth. But I think once

[13:45] you have that solidified it then could

[13:47] take it and run with it and go ahead and

[13:49] you know create those thumbnails for you

[13:50] and whatnot. So it's really important

[13:51] for your audience cuz you just made an

[13:52] amazing point. There's this trend right

[13:54] now about this thing called the Ralph

[13:56] loop right. It's a very mind-numbing

[13:58] thing for most people that are not

[13:59] developers. It's basically this fantasy

[14:01] that you just give tasks and you walk

[14:04] away, go to the beach, and you come back

[14:05] and a bunch of tasks have been executed.

[14:07] It's one thing to execute a 100 tasks.

[14:10] It's another thing for those tasks to be

[14:11] meaningful and derive actual value. So,

[14:13] if you spun up and you said, "Make me

[14:15] a,000 thumbnails and a thousand titles,

[14:17] but 80% are garbage." That's like a net

[14:19] loss. You lost the money on the token

[14:22] usage. You lost time and wasted effort

[14:24] and electricity. Human in the loop plus

[14:26] cloud code is the most OP combination.

[14:29] >> We're going to clip that for for the

[14:31] intro of the video cuz that Yeah, that's

[14:32] fire. Cool. So, now that's a perfect

[14:34] segue into showing what we're going to

[14:36] build cuz we're going to build something

[14:37] pretty similar. I guess real quick

[14:38] before doing that, we should show how do

[14:40] you quickly download this if you're a

[14:42] nontechnical person. Where do you do

[14:43] this? How do you do this in like 2

[14:45] minutes? Let's show that and then we're

[14:46] going to go into the build and show what

[14:47] Mark built us.

[14:48] >> All right, sounds good. Okay. So, when

[14:49] you go to the beautiful domain

[14:51] claw.com/rouct/claw-code,

[14:54] you'll see something like this. And yes,

[14:56] it is a terminal, uh, resist the urge to

[14:58] cry, all you have to do if you're

[15:00] non-technical is you just use this one

[15:03] command in your terminal. And if this

[15:06] immediately gives you an error, most

[15:07] people, many people paste this, there's

[15:09] some form of error because maybe your

[15:10] computer's different, your environment

[15:12] is different, there's something that

[15:13] needs to be reorganized to make this

[15:14] possible. If that is a barrier to you,

[15:17] you can install something called warp.

[15:19] Both of us not affiliated. It is a

[15:21] terminal that you can run pretty much

[15:23] for free. It has some AI in there with a

[15:25] little a free tier. You can just tell it

[15:27] that same command. You copy paste this

[15:29] specific thing right here. And then if

[15:31] there is an error, it will say there's

[15:32] an error, but instead of passing it back

[15:34] to you to figure it out, it will go and

[15:36] figure it out for you on your behalf,

[15:38] ask for permission, and then install

[15:39] Claude Code for you. And then once it's

[15:41] done, you will see your little amigo and

[15:44] it will pop up. You'll see something

[15:46] like that and then you will be good to

[15:47] go. You'll see a screen just like this.

[15:50] >> Perfect. Easy enough.

[15:51] >> Yeah. So, this will be your highway.

[15:52] Again, not affiliated, but it's a free

[15:55] way to one, use a terminal if you ever

[15:57] need to install cloud code, remove cloud

[15:59] code, update cloud code. Really good

[16:01] way. And you can do it for all kinds of

[16:02] things. You can even ask that, by the

[16:04] way, to organize files on your computer.

[16:06] All of these IDEs, as long as they have

[16:08] access to your computer, you're good to

[16:09] go. So that's the installation part. Are

[16:11] we good to jump into the concept?

[16:13] >> Hold on. Before you go to that, let's

[16:15] talk about where users are actually

[16:16] going to begin interfacing with cloud

[16:18] code.

[16:18] >> Yeah. So you can use this in any

[16:20] terminal. You could use warp like I

[16:22] showed you. I like to use it in cursor.

[16:24] You can use anti-gravity. There are so

[16:26] many IDEs that I haven't even mentioned.

[16:28] An IDE is just an editor. You can just

[16:30] open any terminal and once you have this

[16:32] installed and you use the magic words

[16:34] claude, you should see your little crab

[16:36] icon friend pop up and you're good to go

[16:38] from there.

[16:38] >> Perfect. Easy enough. Cool. Now, let's

[16:40] move into let's talk about a what I want

[16:43] to automate first and then we're going

[16:44] to show what we actually or what Mark

[16:46] actually built after that. So, let me

[16:48] I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen

[16:50] now. All right. So, looking at my

[16:51] screen, what I want to automate is my

[16:53] short form content. So, for some of

[16:55] those people or majority of you guys

[16:57] that don't know, I've been kind of going

[16:58] hard on short form content. This is a

[17:00] goal for 2026. I really want to tap into

[17:02] this platform here both on Instagram,

[17:04] YouTube shorts, and Tik Tok. All right.

[17:05] So, about a week ago, I had this video

[17:07] right here go absolutely bananas. It's

[17:09] got about almost like 825,000 views,

[17:12] bunch of engagement, and I've actually

[17:13] grown. Like, I had about like three or

[17:15] 400 followers before this. This singular

[17:17] video is like unlocking this whole new

[17:20] channel that I could tap into. And

[17:21] again, this is a huge goal of mine going

[17:22] into 2026. And then here's a YouTube

[17:24] short, too. I posted this 3 days ago.

[17:26] And this one, I'll just refresh, is

[17:28] absolutely running. So, the goal for

[17:30] what I want to build is I want to build

[17:32] out a system that could help me automate

[17:34] this and so that way I don't need to be

[17:36] super hands-on with it. Cuz right now, I

[17:38] have somebody that's actually writing

[17:39] scripts for me. I have to approve these

[17:41] scripts. I actually go and I analyze

[17:43] what videos did well so I could try to

[17:44] recreate that success of that video. So,

[17:46] if I had a clawed code system that I

[17:48] could just like have on autopilot or I

[17:50] guess I, you know, there'd be a little

[17:51] bit of human in the loop there that

[17:52] could just help systemize this process

[17:54] for me, that would be absolutely like

[17:56] the most valuable thing ever. So Mark

[17:58] actually built that out. So let's go

[17:59] into a little bit more about that.

[18:01] >> Yeah. And if you see on screen there

[18:02] before he unshared the screen, he had 89

[18:05] cents from that video. So in exchange

[18:06] for 89 cents that he's paying me, I

[18:08] built the system for him and show you.

[18:11] >> So let's get into it. Conceptually for

[18:14] the audience so I don't lose you. Core

[18:16] concept is Brock, like you said, wants

[18:18] to go celebrity mode on short form. We

[18:21] wanted to focus primarily on Instagram.

[18:23] So the number one way we need to do that

[18:25] is scrape. Now if we just ask ask claude

[18:27] code go and scrape Instagram that is a

[18:30] very mammoth task because there are many

[18:32] proxy layer security all of these things

[18:35] and to actually do the scraping we're

[18:37] going to use a marketplace called appify

[18:39] you can think of it as the app store

[18:41] where you can take tons of scrapers

[18:42] there's ones literally designed for

[18:44] Instagram Tik Tok what have you and you

[18:47] can essentially lease them or rent them

[18:49] to execute your tasks for a small pay as

[18:51] you go fee so we're going to use that

[18:53] we're going to store it in a database

[18:54] and then we'll use that to help create

[18:57] those ideas for Brock. So again, we're

[18:59] going to focus primarily on Instagram

[19:01] and instead of paying 10 bucks every

[19:03] single time like you're used to doing

[19:04] using platforms like Lovable and Bolt

[19:06] and what have you, we can just use

[19:08] something called SQL Light. And what

[19:10] SQLite is is literally a free database

[19:13] you can run locally on your computer.

[19:15] This frees you because every time I had

[19:17] to experiment before I would have to

[19:19] shell out another 10 bucks of Superbase.

[19:21] So this lets you build Vibe code for

[19:23] free and if you want to go to the next

[19:24] level and then upgrade to Superbase

[19:26] that's always something you can do

[19:27] after. So that's the database we'll be

[19:29] using and in there we'll be posting or

[19:31] hosting things like the creators the

[19:33] posts and the hooks that we scrape. In

[19:35] terms of the workflow if you remember

[19:37] before my YouTube command center I have

[19:39] one input many outputs. In this case,

[19:42] Brock just wants to say the words make

[19:44] me viral as one command and then after

[19:46] that write a topic or a link where

[19:49] Claude can go and read about whatever

[19:50] the tool is and then generate 20 hooks.

[19:53] Then rank those hooks by a virality

[19:55] score. That virality score I'll talk

[19:57] about right below and then we'll pick a

[19:59] top three and then create captions for

[20:01] that. Bro can have one input, one idea

[20:03] and then have multiple outputs.

[20:05] >> Wait question. So go go back up a little

[20:08] bit. So on the topic side of things,

[20:10] context is really important here, right?

[20:11] Cuz if I give like a little short

[20:13] paragraph of what I want the context to

[20:15] be about, it's probably not going to be

[20:16] the best output, right? It's not going

[20:18] to generate the best hooks cuz it's not

[20:19] going to have context or will it take

[20:21] that then do some web searching and then

[20:23] like find the right amount of context

[20:25] and then use that or like am I wrong

[20:27] there? Could you break that down for me?

[20:28] >> No, no, for sure. So the first time you

[20:30] use this, everything we're using is a

[20:32] language model. Language models are not

[20:34] magic. They're not super intelligent.

[20:36] They look for patterns. So if you say go

[20:39] look at this claude code or co-work

[20:41] feature and here's the link and you say

[20:43] nothing else and there's no preferences

[20:45] or examples of how Brock writes his

[20:47] scripts, it will go and look at the

[20:49] database where we've scraped other

[20:50] creators and be like okay I think I'll

[20:52] do a remix between the different

[20:54] creators and my knowledge about writing

[20:55] hooks as of I don't know 2024 or 2025.

[20:58] That will be your first output. Then as

[20:59] you iterate and say no no that's not how

[21:01] I like to write hooks. Here's the

[21:02] example of this 800,000 view video. Try

[21:06] to mimic that style more and tell Claude

[21:08] MD, which is like the command center

[21:10] brain to update that in its memory. So

[21:12] that's how this incrementally gets

[21:13] better.

[21:13] >> Got it. Yeah. So it's just going to

[21:14] literally just get smarter and smarter

[21:16] and smarter the more I use it

[21:17] hypothetically, right?

[21:18] >> Yes. As long as you keep telling it,

[21:19] listen, um, this time this was your

[21:21] mistaken flaw. Let's commit to memory to

[21:23] avoid doing that moving forward. So you

[21:24] have to be proactive in making sure that

[21:26] it learns

[21:27] >> 100%.

[21:28] >> And when it comes to the virality score,

[21:30] we kind of just made this up. Brock and

[21:32] I just to come up with something there

[21:34] would would be some criteria. So this

[21:35] virality score is based off of

[21:37] curiosity, emotion, brevity, relevance.

[21:40] Relevance being like how trendy is the

[21:41] topic, which on short form, even though

[21:43] I'm not a short form guy, seems to be

[21:45] really important, right?

[21:47] >> And then you have uniqueness and

[21:48] platform fit. These ratios could be off.

[21:51] So these weights could be updated. You

[21:53] just want to be able to design the

[21:54] system. So if you need to update them,

[21:56] you can. And then this leads to the

[21:58] overall preview of the process which is

[22:00] you scrape competitors, you get some

[22:02] inspiration, maybe you add your own

[22:04] examples as well. You have some

[22:05] razledazzle. You generate the content

[22:07] and then the final piece of the life

[22:09] cycle which we won't cover in this

[22:10] video, but we c you could do later on is

[22:13] after you create the thing, tell it to

[22:15] go scrape your own Instagram to see how

[22:17] did it do. So it can actually learn from

[22:20] what went well and what didn't go well.

[22:21] That's where you have that full feedback

[22:23] loop.

[22:23] >> Yeah, that analyzing part is the part

[22:25] I'm most excited about honestly. like

[22:26] scraping the competitors is great,

[22:28] coming up with ideas, understanding my

[22:30] hook style, all that stuff, but like

[22:31] analyzing what works because really what

[22:33] I've noticed at least in short form

[22:34] content, you find the like the hooks and

[22:37] the like the format of what works and

[22:39] just double down, triple down on that as

[22:41] opposed to trying a whole bunch of

[22:42] different things, seeing what works and

[22:44] once you find something is really

[22:45] important. That analyzing part of this

[22:46] is what I'm probably the most most

[22:48] stoked about.

[22:49] >> Yes, sir. Yeah. So in terms of the

[22:52] links, these are the links that Brock

[22:53] provided to me of different creators he

[22:55] wants to be inspired by on the short

[22:57] form side. So these were we'll revisit

[23:00] these shortly. And in terms of the

[23:01] actual build, one thing I like to do

[23:04] again cuz I am lazy is you can use

[23:06] whatever research tool you want. In my

[23:08] case, I like to use Perplexity Labs.

[23:10] It's this icon right here. They have a

[23:11] pretty generous free tier as well. And

[23:12] what it allows you to do is give it an

[23:14] idea. So for me, I just use Whisper

[23:16] Flow. I just go off for like five

[23:18] minutes about what I'm trying to build

[23:20] and then I throw that into something

[23:21] like Claude or Chad GBT and tell it can

[23:23] you make this into a more refined prompt

[23:25] for something like perplexity labs and

[23:27] then we get something legendary like

[23:28] this where there's no way I would have

[23:30] actually written it myself where we

[23:31] won't read the whole thing but it just

[23:33] says act as an expert senior product

[23:35] manager and/prompt engineer. I need you

[23:38] to write a highly detailed mega prompt

[23:40] designed for the absolute latest most

[23:42] capable version of cloud code available

[23:44] today. Why do I say this? I want it to

[23:46] know about the latest advancements in

[23:48] cloud code so it can refine the prompt

[23:50] accordingly. So I don't have to worry

[23:51] about what changed in this version, how

[23:53] should I talk to it now. It does that

[23:54] dirty work for me and I say please use

[23:56] your browsing capabilities to verify

[23:58] exactly what version is the

[23:59] state-of-the-art. And then I tell it

[24:01] what the goal is. We want to do a

[24:03] competitor scraper. We want internal

[24:04] analytics. We want a command center uh

[24:06] dashboard later on, not a priority. And

[24:08] then we go through the workflow. So once

[24:10] I do this, it comes back if we zoom back

[24:12] out here with a sample prompt. And I

[24:15] tell it, can you just make this into a

[24:16] markdown file so I can just drag and

[24:19] drop it into a brand new virginized

[24:21] claude folder? It's not even a cloud

[24:23] folder. It's a folder that you import

[24:25] and use cloud code to read what's in

[24:26] that folder.

[24:27] >> So you're just you're just adding that

[24:29] to like your a folder on your desktop

[24:31] essentially. It's as simple as that.

[24:32] >> Literally just to show your audience,

[24:34] you'd go open folder.

[24:36] >> Okay.

[24:37] >> You'd create a new folder and then when

[24:38] you open in cursor here, you'll have

[24:41] absolutely nothing except the name of

[24:43] the folder. This will be empty. So for

[24:45] me, this is where I drag and dropped the

[24:47] exact file I just showed you here. This

[24:49] was the only file in my cursor and

[24:51] nothing else existed. Everything else

[24:53] came about from using cloud code.

[24:55] >> M yeah, easy enough.

[24:56] >> Yeah. So this is the foundation. Now I

[24:59] should have been a bit more intentional

[25:00] to go through the prompt and make sure

[25:02] that all the features that AI came up

[25:03] with are the ones that I care about, but

[25:05] I use this to do this quick and dirty.

[25:07] That's that. In terms of Appify, one of

[25:09] the scrapers will rent is called an

[25:11] Instagram post scraper. This one scrapes

[25:14] the actual posts, captions, etc., but it

[25:17] doesn't take the transcript of the

[25:19] Instagram videos themselves. If you

[25:20] don't feel like going and shopping

[25:22] around to see which app in this Appify

[25:24] app store can do that, you can use their

[25:26] MCP server that can just go and navigate

[25:29] their database for you. So, if you tell

[25:31] it, listen, I need to do X, Y, and Z for

[25:33] the cheapest cost, you will go look at

[25:35] all what are called actors in the app

[25:37] store, pick the cheapest ones and the

[25:39] ones that are most highly rated and

[25:41] recommend those to you. And then you

[25:42] build your workflow after.

[25:43] >> Yeah, that makes it so easy. Got to love

[25:45] the MCP.

[25:46] >> Yes, sir. And then in terms of using and

[25:49] installing the MCP, this is where

[25:50] non-technical people might just tap out.

[25:52] They made it easy as well. So, if you

[25:54] just go to mcp.appify.com

[25:57] exact URL, you'll see something like

[25:58] this. You can pick what matters to you.

[26:01] I would just click on things related to

[26:03] data storage. I would just pick

[26:05] everything if you're just starting out,

[26:06] you don't know what you're doing. And

[26:07] then at the very bottom on integrations,

[26:09] all you have to do is pick on something

[26:10] like cursor or cloud code. And then it

[26:12] will give you the oneline command. And

[26:14] if you click on add API token, it will

[26:16] put a placeholder. All you have to do is

[26:19] go and get your appy API key from your

[26:21] account, which if you go to your account

[26:23] is literally right here. You grab this,

[26:25] you paste that exactly in here, right

[26:28] there instead of these little curly

[26:29] brackets. You take this command, you

[26:32] open a brand new terminal session with

[26:34] cloud code, and you paste it. So, I will

[26:36] show you in one second after I block my

[26:38] API key what it looks like and we'll go

[26:39] from there.

[26:40] >> Yeah, I got one thing to say on that cuz

[26:41] I've used Amplify in the past for

[26:43] certain builds and edit end for example

[26:44] to try to create the same thing. And

[26:46] finding an actor that actually works

[26:48] sometimes was a pain because it worked

[26:50] in the past and then something broke and

[26:52] it wasn't up to date. They weren't like

[26:54] servicing it, whatever. I don't even

[26:55] know. But I think the MCP thing makes it

[26:57] so much more simple. And I'm glad that

[26:58] you brought that up because then it'll

[27:00] just go ahead find which one is working

[27:01] right now. So you don't need to go and

[27:03] do that yourself.

[27:04] >> Or it will actually just test them. So

[27:05] it'll run it. It'll be like this one

[27:07] sucks. Let me go search for another one.

[27:09] This one sucks. I'll go search for

[27:10] another one. It will do the dirty work

[27:11] for you, which is why I like that. So

[27:13] this is what it looks like in cursor.

[27:15] Obviously I have blocked my API keys. I

[27:17] pasted that exact command I showed you

[27:19] before. So that claude MCP add ampify. I

[27:23] just had to add my API key right here.

[27:25] And then it went executed that command

[27:28] and then it comes back at the bottom

[27:30] saying successfully added. And all you

[27:31] have to do is restart a brand new

[27:34] session in cloud code and it will take

[27:36] effect. And I'll show you how you can

[27:37] verify that you have that MCP server.

[27:40] When you have a brand new tab, you just

[27:42] have to write MCP and then put MCP

[27:45] status. You'll see right here we have

[27:46] this connected. So we know we are in

[27:48] Valhalla. We are good to go. We are in

[27:50] the promised land and beyond that all

[27:53] you have to do is I just said are you

[27:55] able to find this? So I told it go and

[27:58] look for this appy scraper. I just want

[27:59] to double check it's working. You can

[28:01] see right here as soon as you see this

[28:02] little green icon and you see mcp

[28:05] something the mcp is working. So it

[28:07] found it and it tells me about it. It

[28:09] tells me about the success rate the

[28:10] total number of users which is awesome

[28:12] cuz like Brock said it's always aware of

[28:15] what is being used. So, it can rank the

[28:17] actors by usage and success rate. And it

[28:19] tells you what it does, the pricing, the

[28:21] input parameters of what it needs and

[28:23] what you can offer it. And then I said,

[28:25] can you can I scrape the transcript of

[28:27] videos? And it says, no, you can't,

[28:28] which is where I discovered that. So, it

[28:30] can do metadata, performance, but it

[28:32] can't do that. So, then it went and

[28:34] found three alternatives with their

[28:36] respective su success rates and their

[28:38] pricing, which is why this is so

[28:39] awesome. It's very hands-off. You are

[28:42] the boss, and it tells you what is the

[28:43] best choice and why. Once we do that, I

[28:45] say, "Cool. Can we test it on this?" We

[28:47] take Nexv's short form. We ask it for,

[28:50] let's say, the first three videos. It

[28:52] doesn't work. And then it hangs. And

[28:54] then I basically try to understand why

[28:56] is it hanging until it finally comes

[28:58] back with the following. So this is the

[29:00] caption. This is everything about that

[29:02] video. So I'm like, cool. Now we're

[29:04] cooking with gas. We try a few more

[29:06] posts and I I say, can you try three

[29:08] posts at once and see what happens? So

[29:10] the first one works perfectly. You can

[29:12] see right here, this is the source URL.

[29:14] If I scroll to the very right and I grab

[29:17] this, you can see, let me see, right

[29:20] here. 0 to 40 seconds, 0 to 8 seconds.

[29:23] Okay, stop building your automations

[29:24] from scratch. Instead, use this AI tool.

[29:27] So now I know, cool, that is a script.

[29:29] And our next job at some point will be

[29:31] how do we extract what we think is the

[29:33] [music] hook? Because short form is

[29:35] short. So how do you know which one is

[29:37] the hook if you don't see the first 5

[29:39] seconds or the first line or the first

[29:40] two lines? So, there's going to be some

[29:42] judgment there and there's some nuance

[29:43] which is why this is not perfect. One

[29:45] thing I did notice is that the MCP had

[29:47] an aneurysm and when I tried to make it

[29:49] do three at once. So, it turns out at

[29:51] least for this actor, it needs to do one

[29:53] at a time, not all at the same time. So,

[29:55] once it did that, it was able to do one

[29:57] one and then we were good to go. And

[29:59] then you can see right here, this is the

[30:00] transcript that comes back from each and

[30:02] every video along with the original URL.

[30:06] So, that's kind of like the end of the

[30:07] first session. And I basically say the

[30:08] following because every session in cloud

[30:11] code is a brand new blank slate for the

[30:13] most part outside of whatever you have

[30:15] in this file called cloud MD. You can

[30:17] think of claude MD as your memory bank.

[30:19] The same way you'd have memory and

[30:20] chatbt. The one thing that we have to

[30:22] know is I don't want to have to go

[30:23] through every single time with blank

[30:25] screen and say go and get me the

[30:27] transcript of this video for it to have

[30:29] to go in circles to realize one it

[30:31] doesn't have one actor to do that. It

[30:33] has to do two of them. And then two that

[30:35] it has to do one at a time. So instead

[30:37] of me having to worry about that, I just

[30:39] say take note on how you're able to

[30:40] scrape these transcripts and what actors

[30:42] you used and create a claude MD file

[30:45] that I would have a full understanding

[30:46] of how to execute this. So I don't have

[30:48] to repeat myself each and every [music]

[30:50] time. So you didn't even usually like if

[30:52] you're interacting with like AI chatbt

[30:54] claude whatever you'd say that like oh

[30:56] give me a prompt to use to then always

[30:58] know how to perform this task but inside

[31:00] of cloud code this is like what stands

[31:01] out to me is it literally went and

[31:02] created that we could call that a skill

[31:05] right is that considered a skill in

[31:06] cloud

[31:06] >> I won't I won't let you say skill

[31:08] because that'll that'll be misleading so

[31:10] >> it's not a skill it's just it's creating

[31:13] this

[31:13] >> knowledge base

[31:14] >> knowledge base let's call it knowledge

[31:15] base yes

[31:16] >> okay got it yeah that's cool it

[31:17] literally created that file instead of

[31:18] just giving like a prompt that you would

[31:20] usually get that you'd have to you like

[31:22] save somewhere in your notes, use it

[31:23] whenever like when you know whenever

[31:24] you're using a custom GPT for example

[31:26] but

[31:26] >> yeah and if you click on it they make it

[31:28] like a hyperlink especially in cursor

[31:29] you can see like top priority is like

[31:31] the make me viral command that's after

[31:33] we actually built it out but if as you

[31:35] go through it takes notes on the

[31:37] different data models you have the hook

[31:40] ranking algorithm we ended up making

[31:42] everything that it needs to use so he

[31:43] has a section here on actors used so now

[31:45] it knows this is the app ampify actor

[31:48] name this is the cost and the second one

[31:50] we used to actually grab the transcript

[31:52] of the video is this one. So it keeps

[31:53] that running memory which is why this

[31:55] [music] is powerful

[31:55] >> and ideally it's going to be way quicker

[31:57] every like at least after that initial

[31:59] time because now it knows exactly what

[32:00] to do so it doesn't need to go through

[32:02] this treadmill thought process of trying

[32:03] to figure it out.

[32:04] >> Yeah. So if you compare it to something

[32:05] like a chatbt, every single time you

[32:07] fail in chatbt, if you don't if you

[32:10] aren't proactive to go and document and

[32:12] avoid it happening, it will keep

[32:13] happening over and over again. But in

[32:15] cloud code, every time something doesn't

[32:18] go as planned, you can say go and learn

[32:20] from this mistake as soon as you finally

[32:21] get to the point where it did the right

[32:22] thing. That's where you have that

[32:23] feedback loop. Now [music] to make this

[32:25] a lot more tactical, this session was

[32:28] about executing the plan. So for me, if

[32:30] you go to here, this is the plan. This

[32:32] is an adapted version of what I created

[32:35] in Perplexity Labs. This is the

[32:36] original. And what I asked for in a

[32:38] separate chat was, can you make this

[32:40] thing instead of just a list of feature

[32:42] requests and a wish list, can you make

[32:44] it into a plan and make it so that there

[32:46] are checkboxes so that you can keep

[32:48] track of what you're doing as you

[32:50] accomplish each task? Now, why did I do

[32:52] this? One, it's no secret that Claude

[32:55] has a context window as of this

[32:57] recording of 200,000 tokens. MCP servers

[33:00] actually take a lot of that. that. So,

[33:01] it can take anywhere between 2 to 15% of

[33:04] that session. So, instead of me running

[33:06] into a maxed window every single time

[33:08] and worrying about that, if it keeps

[33:10] checking off what it's completed, I can

[33:12] always go back and be like, listen, go

[33:14] pick up where you left off on the plan.

[33:16] So, I can see like, okay, cool. I

[33:18] haven't started phase 2.3. Let's keep

[33:20] going from there.

[33:21] >> Yeah, that makes sense.

[33:22] >> Yeah. [music]

[33:22] So, that's super helpful, which is why I

[33:24] ended up creating this plan. And the

[33:27] plan, you'll see right here, as it

[33:28] completes things, it will tell you this

[33:30] is completed, this is not completed, and

[33:32] it'll keep editing the source plan until

[33:34] we're good to go. And you can see here,

[33:35] it's using the MCP server to test out

[33:38] again the different appy posts,

[33:41] scraping, and then if we go to the very

[33:43] bottom here, it's using and creating

[33:45] what's called the SQLite database. So,

[33:47] like I said before, if you click on

[33:48] database and click on short form, this

[33:51] is what it looks like behind the scenes.

[33:52] So, you don't need to use a superbase.

[33:54] It creates all of your database for

[33:57] free. You can see all the columns here.

[33:58] And if this is too ugly for you, I had a

[34:01] separate chat where I said, can you make

[34:02] it so that we can have some form of UI

[34:05] to look at this. So this was the chat. I

[34:06] said, can you make it so we have UI? I

[34:08] hate looking at it here. So I talked to

[34:10] it like my friend and you can talk to it

[34:12] as well. And you get something like this

[34:14] where you can click on it and when I uh

[34:16] load it back up, you'll be able to see

[34:18] the different tables like hooks and

[34:19] posts, etc. That's basically you'll be

[34:21] able to interact with it on a browser.

[34:22] >> Yeah. much easier to look at than the

[34:24] the IDE that we're looking at here.

[34:26] >> Yeah, it's basically like having a

[34:27] Google sheet on steroids. And the most

[34:28] important thing, like I said, is it's

[34:30] free. So, one thing I wanted to do now

[34:32] is put everything into practice. And I

[34:35] noticed that we encountered a bug. I

[34:37] thought that things were running super

[34:39] smooth. We have the MCP. It learned how

[34:41] to scrape. And I started storing things

[34:43] in our database and started creating the

[34:46] viral hooks algorithm so I could create

[34:48] this post creator. And then I realized

[34:50] that there was one fundamental flaw. And

[34:52] I'm just gonna wait to just pull that up

[34:53] so your audience doesn't have to watch

[34:55] me scroll.

[34:55] >> Yeah, sounds good.

[34:56] >> Okay, so here at some point I realized

[34:58] that it was making a fundamental

[35:00] mistake. It was scraping everything, but

[35:03] it would put the caption in the

[35:05] transcripts column. And you might say,

[35:07] why do I care? Well, you care because it

[35:10] was training on these hooks that were

[35:13] actually the caption. So, it learned to

[35:16] say, "Comment X and I will send you Y

[35:19] instead of the actual hook of the

[35:20] videos." And I got confused because I

[35:22] started getting tens of hooks that all

[35:24] started with comment Y for X. And I'm

[35:26] like, this is not a hook. So then I went

[35:28] to look at the database and I'm like,

[35:29] you literally put the captions in the

[35:32] transcript and you never actually

[35:33] captured and saved the transcript. So at

[35:35] this point, that's why I said I just

[35:37] noticed that your hooks are the

[35:38] captions. This is wrong. So it went

[35:41] through, it deleted all the things uh

[35:44] that were incorrect. And then it

[35:46] reloaded and went through and just kept

[35:48] only the posts. And then we start adding

[35:50] on the transcripts. So when we finally

[35:53] go the the next step, which is okay, now

[35:55] that we have transcripts in there, we

[35:57] come up with the virality score, it goes

[35:59] through and it creates like a ranking of

[36:01] all the posts in the database. So if we

[36:03] go to the database and you check the

[36:05] scores, you'll be able to see that

[36:07] they're actually implemented and

[36:08] calculated on the fly. So that allows us

[36:11] to do the following. If I go into here,

[36:14] so if we say make me viral, this new

[36:17] feature, this is the command that in

[36:19] claude MD, our memory bank or knowledge

[36:21] base as we've now call it, I just said

[36:23] go and look at this feature and come up

[36:25] with material. You'll notice that

[36:27] despite that, we still have a couple of

[36:29] them that were biased from before. I

[36:31] think Claude MD did hadn't updated yet.

[36:33] It says comment co-work to get free

[36:34] access, but we still did have some real

[36:37] hooks for the most part. So 8020 80%

[36:40] were actual hooks, but we still wanted

[36:42] this to be 100%. So

[36:44] >> here, go up one more time.

[36:45] >> Yeah,

[36:46] >> I want to point one of these out. Like

[36:47] for example, number two, that hook

[36:50] pretty solid. Claude just became your AI

[36:51] co-orker that actually finishes tasks

[36:53] without you. Like that's something that

[36:54] I would actually use in one of my short

[36:56] form videos. So that's I mean goes to

[36:58] show that it's at least working.

[36:59] >> Yeah. And maybe you could use the

[37:00] comment coowork in the caption. This is

[37:02] solid for the caption as long as it

[37:05] knows what to do. But I just wanted to

[37:06] show this because it's important to know

[37:08] that especially if you go on X,

[37:10] especially the dark depths of X, people

[37:12] will say this thing will replace

[37:14] software engineers like remove

[37:16] everything from existence. It still

[37:17] makes mistakes. It should have been

[37:18] smart enough. If it can use an MCP

[37:20] server to see what actor we need, it

[37:22] should be able to look at it and be

[37:23] like, oh, this is probably not a hook.

[37:25] But you have to be aware that like you

[37:26] can't just go off to the beach and come

[37:28] back and expect good results, especially

[37:30] if you're not a non techie. So human in

[37:32] the loop watching this is essential.

[37:34] Yeah, that's like the key word for this

[37:36] episode, I think, is human in the loop.

[37:38] Because otherwise, we could build out

[37:39] this system if we're not constantly

[37:40] iterating with it. It's probably not

[37:42] going to be the best. So, that's why

[37:43] this is a good starting point for us and

[37:45] for me to start using. I'm excited to

[37:46] see what this looks like a month after

[37:48] playing around with this, having to test

[37:50] out different videos that I post and

[37:51] giving my thoughts and, you know, kind

[37:53] of expertise on it.

[37:54] >> Yeah. And the thing is, you can go much

[37:56] deeper than this. So, right now, this is

[37:57] the scoring algorithm where you can see,

[37:59] right, like we said before, curiosity,

[38:02] emotion, etc. It's using its judgment

[38:05] like Claude is going through and ranking

[38:07] everything that we have in our database

[38:08] with a score. Brock can look at this and

[38:10] be like, "No, you are so wrong. That

[38:12] last video was a complete flop or this

[38:14] video did incredibly well." So, this

[38:16] will take tinkering. And if you had vibe

[38:18] coded a front end, every single time you

[38:20] would change the way you the the process

[38:22] flows and the automation flows, you'd

[38:24] have to go and rework the UI to match

[38:26] it. So, that's where like the UI and

[38:29] everything that we focused on for the

[38:30] past year, which is, oh, cool. I just

[38:32] built a clone of X, it's not about the

[38:34] clone, it's about like what is beneath

[38:36] it? What is the system underneath it? So

[38:38] when Brock spends a couple weeks until

[38:41] it's actually really good, then he could

[38:43] ask, cool, can we just spin up a UI and

[38:46] maybe we'll use Gemini as the LLM to go

[38:49] do the analysis or Anthropic or whatever

[38:51] to execute everything that we've been

[38:52] doing in the terminal. So in a way you

[38:54] you leave the final part for last where

[38:57] if you have a UI, if you have a product

[38:58] of your own, it's now fully polished.

[39:01] That's actually like a super good point

[39:03] because I was going to say looking at

[39:04] this viral scorecard thing here. I was

[39:07] like, man, this just seems like a lot of

[39:08] numbers. I'd love if it were in a

[39:11] dashboard. I was literally going to

[39:12] mention that, but that's such a good

[39:13] point because if I don't have this thing

[39:15] dialed in, so to say, like right now,

[39:17] it's just going to be a pain in the ass

[39:18] having to go back and forth and try to

[39:19] vibe code. My audience knows how to vibe

[39:21] code and how it could be such a pain so

[39:23] many so much of the time. So, yeah,

[39:25] that's interesting. I'm excited to see

[39:26] what it looks like when it's an almost

[39:28] like its own little mini like internal

[39:30] software that I could use instead of

[39:31] having to use something that might be a

[39:33] little bit more intimidating like cursor

[39:36] or something like that.

[39:37] >> Exactly. So, and then the whole point is

[39:38] that it gives you all of these as

[39:40] outputs. So, it tells you now as a top

[39:41] three hooks. So, tells you why it's a

[39:44] hook, why it's a good hook rather. So,

[39:46] this one Claude code just gave

[39:47] non-coders. Lily picked the same one, by

[39:49] the way, that you said is a good one,

[39:51] which is interesting that it agrees and

[39:53] it comes with the rest of them. Still

[39:55] has this weird comment thing you would

[39:57] have to remove from it. And then it

[39:59] comes up with the captions. And what's

[40:01] funny is it wrote the captions as as

[40:05] these. This changes everything. It

[40:07] doesn't have the comment

[40:08] >> even though that's the hook, right?

[40:09] That's uh Wait, would that be the hook

[40:11] or like the script? I mean,

[40:12] >> I think it could be a caption, but it's

[40:13] interesting that I didn't put the

[40:14] comment X or Y, even though we it's very

[40:17] prevalent in the small data we have. So,

[40:19] there's a lot of nuance here. This is

[40:21] super.

[40:21] >> However, this would be really sorry to

[40:23] cut you off, but this would be super

[40:24] easy for me to give cloud code one

[40:27] prompt and say, hey, listen, for every

[40:29] or for every description or yeah, I

[40:32] guess it'd be considered a description.

[40:33] I want it I want to use a keyword where

[40:35] it says comment X, I'll send you Y. And

[40:38] then it'll fix that. Now, every single

[40:40] time I use it, it'll like understand

[40:41] that, right?

[40:42] >> Yeah. And even better, since we have the

[40:43] Ampify MCP already used, you could say,

[40:46] "Can you go on my Instagram, look at the

[40:48] top five performing ones, go grab my

[40:51] style of captions, and go grab my style

[40:54] of hooks on the ones that performed

[40:55] well, and in the database, I want to

[40:58] change the score. Now, I want to add a

[41:00] Brock uh waiting where if it's a hook by

[41:04] me that did well, I want you to weight

[41:06] it higher than the other creators cuz

[41:08] other creators aren't me. So, this is

[41:10] where the nuance comes in and instead of

[41:12] you obsessing on updating a front end

[41:14] and some button not working and you

[41:15] spend an hour fixing the button even

[41:17] though the process needs to change, you

[41:19] focus on the stuff that actually moves

[41:20] the needle.

[41:20] >> Yeah, this is this is great, dude. This

[41:22] is honestly better than I thought it was

[41:23] going to be if I'm being completely

[41:24] honest with you. Like, I'm stoked to

[41:26] play around with this.

[41:27] >> Good. Good. Okay, just everyone in the

[41:28] audience, this is a process. And the

[41:30] thing is, if you use something like an

[41:31] anti-gravity or a cursor, this is my

[41:34] special weapon is obviously you're

[41:35] dealing with claude here, but let's say

[41:37] you need virgin eyes on your your code

[41:40] or anything that you're generating, you

[41:42] can always bring in cursor for free for

[41:44] like they have a pretty generous free

[41:45] tier as long as you don't use max mode.

[41:47] And you can be like, cool, what does

[41:49] codeex or GPT 5.2 think about my system

[41:53] to generate hooks? So you can bring in

[41:55] different advisors, if you will, to take

[41:58] a look at the same codebase, whether

[42:00] you're vibe coding something or just

[42:01] producing something at scale.

[42:02] >> So you're saying as these models get

[42:04] better, you could then use that as

[42:06] almost like the orchestrator to

[42:07] understand how could I optimize this

[42:09] kind of is what you're saying.

[42:10] >> So let's say you actually ended up

[42:11] building this UI and for whatever reason

[42:13] cloud code wasn't cutting it. It just

[42:15] wasn't getting you. Maybe you bring in a

[42:17] virginized expert in the form of Gemini

[42:20] 3 Pro and you say, "Hey, look, both of

[42:22] these share the same codebase. So this

[42:24] codebase, anything that's in cursor can

[42:25] see this. So cloud can see this and

[42:28] anything in cursor can see this. So with

[42:30] that, you can go like in ask mode and be

[42:32] like, listen, can you take a look and

[42:33] give me advice on how I could structure

[42:35] this better? Or even more hacky, you

[42:37] could say, go and search the web for

[42:40] best practices for prompting cloud code.

[42:42] Can you help me draft a prompt that

[42:44] would fix this problem that's happening

[42:45] in my codebase? And then it could go

[42:47] search the codebase and then go and

[42:49] search the best way to prompt it. And

[42:51] then you can copy paste the prompt from

[42:53] here to here. So there's so many ways

[42:54] you could use this dynamic duo.

[42:57] >> Yeah, I love it. That's super important.

[42:58] Like I didn't know you could do that. So

[43:00] that's that's a good tip.

[43:01] >> There you go. But yeah, with that like

[43:03] obviously we could go so much deeper,

[43:05] make this infinitely better, but it's

[43:06] the idea of just like you attach a

[43:07] couple tools, you throw some API keys,

[43:10] you give it some prompt, and then you

[43:11] start the progress. like to build upon

[43:13] that, not that we're going to do this in

[43:14] this video, but a use case I would see

[43:16] for this is I have been using or I've

[43:19] been creating thumbnails for my short

[43:20] form videos on Instagram just because it

[43:22] looks better on my profile, whatever.

[43:24] So, literally I could do what you did

[43:26] for YouTube where you have this using

[43:27] Nano Banana via the API for Gemini and

[43:30] it goes and actually creates these

[43:32] thumbnails for you using an image

[43:33] generation tool. And that might be the

[43:35] next thing that I personally go in and

[43:37] actually try to build out because that'd

[43:38] be super helpful. you built something

[43:40] that's a bit more intricate than like

[43:42] short form video. I feel like the system

[43:44] you built with YouTube is like five step

[43:46] a couple steps ahead of this and it's

[43:48] just crazy to see like what we could do

[43:50] with Claude code. So this video is

[43:52] giving me FOMO Mark. So I'm going to

[43:53] need to hop off like dive in.

[43:57] >> Yeah. On that thumbnail thing just like

[43:58] to inspire people. So, the way I I

[44:00] created it is I have Nano Banana create

[44:03] the concept and then it draft it out as

[44:06] a doodle and then it takes that doodle

[44:08] and it takes that pumps it to Nanabanana

[44:10] again to create version one of the

[44:12] thumbnail and then it loads that into

[44:15] Gemini to get its opinion on the image

[44:17] as a YouTube expert and then after it

[44:19] roasts it, it injects its feedback back

[44:22] to the Nano Banana to fix it. So, I have

[44:25] this feedback loop where before I take a

[44:27] look at it, it's already pre-roasted

[44:28] itself, which is why again, this is such

[44:30] a high lever skill. If you're non

[44:32] techie, this is the time, this is the

[44:34] perfect time to jump in and just get

[44:36] your feet wet.

[44:37] >> Yeah, that's and that's I love to hear

[44:39] that. One one other thing I want to

[44:41] mention before we end this episode

[44:42] because we obviously showed kind of what

[44:44] we built here or what Mark built here.

[44:46] Go back to that Excali board you showed

[44:49] because correct me if I'm wrong, you

[44:50] built this with Claude code, didn't you?

[44:52] You didn't even build this out yourself.

[44:54] No, I have a system that I built in

[44:55] cloud code that helps me make

[44:57] explanatory diagrams especially for my

[44:59] YouTube where it's doodles so it makes

[45:01] things a lot more consumable. So I will

[45:03] walk through like I literally talked to

[45:05] I'm like listen I'm about to hop on

[45:07] Brock's podcast on his channel. His

[45:10] focus is not as developery. I want to

[45:12] break this down. So help me make three

[45:14] to five images where you think this

[45:16] concept would like be done justice and

[45:18] then it takes care of it from there.

[45:19] >> Dude, I [laughter] love that. That's

[45:20] just hilarious. I love that you did

[45:22] that. All right, so this episode's been

[45:24] amazing. I'm excited to go ahead and try

[45:26] this stuff now and actually begin using

[45:27] this system, build other things on top

[45:29] of it. But Mark, if we could give the

[45:31] viewer of this, a complete non-technical

[45:32] person, one actionable item to do right

[45:34] now, like instead of just watching this

[45:36] video, taking notes, and doing nothing

[45:37] with it, what could they do right this

[45:39] second to actually take that first step,

[45:41] begin begin learning this, and hopefully

[45:43] building the skill that could change

[45:44] their life over the coming years?

[45:46] >> Yeah. So I'll I'll give the advice with

[45:48] a grain of salt because I know people

[45:49] will look at this and even if we prove

[45:52] that it's effective, they still won't

[45:53] download the terminal. So if that is the

[45:55] friction point, you literally have

[45:57] something that's dropped from the

[45:58] heavens in the form of co-work which is

[46:00] not perfect. It's still not an imperfect

[46:02] product, but it will give you this

[46:04] little taste of what it could look like

[46:06] to run agentic workflows. You won't get

[46:08] the breadth, you won't get the depth,

[46:10] but it will get you more comfortable and

[46:12] hopefully it will give you FOMO that if

[46:14] you had instead of a basic engine, you

[46:16] had the full firepower of a V9, V8

[46:19] engine that you could run that much

[46:21] farther. So, instead of having to go

[46:23] from zero to deep end, you can go from

[46:25] zero to shallow, get your feet wet, get

[46:28] used to it, and then when you're ready,

[46:29] make a couple commands, and then start

[46:31] your Cloud Code journey.

[46:32] >> And keep in mind, this is a tool that

[46:33] dropped literally yesterday. So, this is

[46:35] your sign from the heavens, like you

[46:37] said, to go and try this and test this

[46:38] out. There's no excuses now. Um, Mark,

[46:40] this has been awesome, man. I appreciate

[46:41] it. Thanks for building this for me.

[46:43] Thanks for explaining it. Where could my

[46:44] audience find you?

[46:45] >> For sure. So, um, mark_ashiff on

[46:48] YouTube. If you are someone that is

[46:50] interested on the deep end of things,

[46:52] you don't want to be just non- tech. You

[46:54] want to go really hard. Um, you could

[46:55] look check out my early AI adopters

[46:57] community. That's where I go hard all

[46:59] the time and I build all kinds of

[47:00] things. And outside of that, hopefully

[47:02] more on Brock's channel. [laughter]

[47:03] >> Yeah. I want to give kudos to Mark's

[47:05] community too cuz I've been in there for

[47:07] I don't know probably over 6 months now.

[47:09] Honestly, if I want to learn something

[47:10] that's a bit more technical, that is my

[47:12] favorite place to go. Kind of cuts

[47:13] through the noise of everything else.

[47:14] Don't have to go on YouTube or X and

[47:16] like get my anxiety up and my FOMO up.

[47:18] Instead, I'll just go straight to Mark's

[47:20] community. It's a great place. So, yeah,

[47:22] Mark, thanks for coming on, man. Sure.

[47:23] We'll have you on soon. Have a good one.

[47:25] guys.
